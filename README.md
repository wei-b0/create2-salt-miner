# ⛏️ Salty – CREATE2 Salt Miner (Pattern-Based Fork)

Nickname: `salty`

An _extremely_ fast miner for finding salts that create vanity Ethereum addresses via `CREATE2` with **pattern-based matching**.

This fork extends the original Salty miner to support searching for specific hex patterns in the resulting contract addresses, enabling true vanity address mining beyond just leading zeros. Pattern matching is the default and only active mode in the current code.

Salty can run for a really long time and will keep finding better salts. It is recommended to leave it running for a few hours if you're looking to find a salt that results in an efficient address.

Salty is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), uses [Alloy](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core) for Ethereum primitives and uses [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) as the processing backend.

Salty always uses OpenCL, which means it can utilize a wide variety of systems including CPUs, GPUs and supported accelerators. It is highly recommended to use GPUs for mining as they are significantly faster than CPUs. If you'd like to use CPUs, you'll need to install the OpenCL Driver for your platform. Typically, for all `x86-64` systems, [Intel's OpenCL Driver](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/opencl-drivers.html) works best.

Using OpenCL Platform as the backend also means you can run it across multiple GPUs as long as they are grouped in the same OpenCL Platform. By default, if your GPUs are from the same vendor, the drivers will automatically group them. Additional configuration may be required if you have GPUs from different vendors.

## Usage

Salty is currently tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. It works with CPUs, GPUs and Accelerators.

You'll need Rust and OpenCL SDK installed and available in `PATH`. Start by cloning the repository.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wei-b0/create2-salt-miner.git
```

You can then run it with `cargo` by providing each option as an argument.

```bash
cargo run --release -- mine --factory 0x0000000000FFe8B47B3e2130213B802212439497                            \
                            --caller 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045                             \
                            --codehash 0x64e604787cbf194841e7b68d7cd28786f6c9a0a3ab9f8b0a0e87cb4387ab0107
```

Alternatively, you can create a file named `salty.toml` in root with the same parameter names and simply run the miner. A sample file is included in this repo. CLI arguments take precedence so any arguments you provide via the CLI will override the arguments provided via the config file.

```bash
cargo run --release -- mine
```

Additionally, Salty includes a `list` command to display all available OpenCL platforms on the device.

```bash
cargo run --release -- list
```

## Parameters

The following parameters are available when using the `mine` command.

| Option     | Description                                                           | Default                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `factory`  | Factory address that will be used to deploy the contract via CREATE2  | `0x0000000000FFe8B47B3e2130213B802212439497` |
| `caller`   | Caller for the deployment                                             | (required parameter)                         |
| `codehash` | Keccak-256 hash of the contract initialization code                   | (required parameter)                         |
| `worksize` | Work size per batch                                                   | `0x4400000`                                  |
| `pattern`  | Hex pattern to search for in the resulting address (e.g., "deadbeef") | (required; default mode)                     |

## Browser (WASM) Build

This repo now includes a browser-hosted WASM miner with a minimal UI in `web/`.

### Build

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack
wasm-pack build --release --target web --out-dir web/pkg --no-default-features --features wasm
```

### Run Locally

Use any static file server. For best performance (and SharedArrayBuffer support), set COOP/COEP headers:

```bash
cd web
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in a modern browser.

### Required Headers

For multi-worker performance, set:

```
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

Sample configs are included at `web/_headers` (Netlify) and `web/vercel.json`.

## Performance Benchmarks

| Platform          | Platform Type  | Speed |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Nvidia RTX 3070   | GPU (CUDA)     | 1,250 |
| Apple M1 Pro      | Hybrid (Metal) | 40    |
| AMD Ryzen 5 3600  | CPU (PoCL)     | TODO  |
| AMD Ryzen 9 5900X | CPU (PoCL)     | TODO  |

Speed is measured in million attempts per second.
